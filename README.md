**Tea Plantation Analysis Using Geospatial Data - Documentation**

**Objective:**
The primary goal of this project is to leverage high-resolution georeferenced imagery captured via drones to automate tea leaf harvesting. The specific objectives include vegetation classification, area estimation, width analysis of plantation rows, and the creation of a navigation map for an automated tea rover.

**Approach:**

1. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Acquired highly accurate georeferenced drone imagery of the tea plantation.
   - Utilized less accurate data including Digital Terrain Model (DTM), Digital Surface Model (DSM), and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for elevation data.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Resampled all datasets to a common target shape for consistency in analysis.
   - Extracted relevant bands from the imagery, such as NIR, to enhance vegetation analysis.

3. **Vegetation Classification:**
   - Developed a classification algorithm to identify and classify vegetation regions within the tea plantation.
   - Utilized NIR bands for enhanced discrimination of vegetation.

4. **Area Estimation:**
   - Applied polygonal segmentation to classified vegetation regions to estimate the area of each polygon.
   - Created an attribute dataset containing the area of each classified polygon.

5. **Width Analysis:**
   - Employed image processing techniques to determine the width of plantation rows.
   - Identified regions where the bush width significantly deviates from the standard range (1.2 meters).

6. **Navigation Map for Tea Rover:**
   - Generated a georeferenced navigation map highlighting areas that require special attention due to varying bush widths.

**Experimentation Results:**
- **Vegetation Classification:**
  - Achieved accurate classification of vegetation regions.
  - NIR bands proved effective in distinguishing between different types of vegetation.

- **Area Estimation:**
  - Successfully calculated the area of each classified polygon.
  - Provided valuable insights into the distribution of vegetation within the plantation.

- **Width Analysis:**
  - Detected regions where the width of plantation rows deviated significantly from the standard range.
  - Critical areas were identified for potential manual intervention or adjustments to the tea rover's navigation.

- **Navigation Map for Tea Rover:**
  - Created a georeferenced map for precise navigation of the automated tea rover.
  - Highlighted areas requiring special attention, improving rover efficiency.

**Observations:**
- The integration of geospatial data allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the tea plantation, providing valuable insights for automation.
- The use of NIR bands enhanced the accuracy of vegetation classification and area estimation.
- Width analysis revealed areas with potential navigational challenges for the tea rover.

**Future Considerations:**
- Further refinement of algorithms to improve accuracy in width analysis.
- Integration of real-time data for dynamic adjustments in tea rover navigation.
- Continuous monitoring and adaptation of the system based on changing plantation conditions.

**Conclusion:**
The tea plantation analysis using geospatial data demonstrated successful automation possibilities for tea leaf harvesting. The combination of accurate imagery, elevation data, and advanced algorithms facilitated precise classification, area estimation, and width analysis. The generated navigation map serves as a valuable tool for the efficient and automated operation of the tea rover. This project lays the foundation for future advancements in agricultural automation and geospatial applications in tea plantations.
